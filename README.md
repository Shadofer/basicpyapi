# A basic websocket API made in python

## What's the purpose of this project?

**Demonstrates the ```websockets``` package and shows how to create a server which responds to given data.**

**Provides client-side code in order to create an effective loop of data.**

**Both models are extensible and customisable.**

## Is this a production product?

**Of course not, it only contains barebone code which is meant to be optimised and tailored to your specific needs.**

## Are there any other websocket-relevant projects?
